# map-api

 This project is for simple Location detection and sharing Web Application.
 I build this project with ES6 vanilla JS and nodeJS. Use MongoDB to save requests and create a share link.
 Use Google MAP API for Location visuality and handle requests. And use WebpackJS for bundle this project.
 Also i have share a link for this project deployed in Firebase.
